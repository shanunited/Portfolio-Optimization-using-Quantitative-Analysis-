📊 Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategies

📌 Overview

This project applies Unsupervised Learning techniques to analyze stock market trends and optimize trading strategies. It primarily focuses on clustering S&P 500 stocks based on financial metrics and technical indicators to uncover hidden patterns.

🔍 Key Features

🚀 Data Collection:

Extracts S&P 500 stock data from Wikipedia.

Fetches historical stock prices using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).

📈 Feature Engineering:

Computes technical indicators with pandas_ta (Moving Averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands).

Uses returns, volatility, and momentum-based features.

📊 Unsupervised Learning Approaches:

K-Means Clustering for stock grouping.

Hierarchical Clustering for deeper pattern analysis.

📉 Portfolio Optimization:

Applies PyPortfolioOpt to construct optimized portfolios.

Evaluates risk-adjusted returns using key financial metrics.
